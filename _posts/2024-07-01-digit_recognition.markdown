This project focuses on artificial cell division driven by oscillatory phenomena, leveraging de novo protein design. My work involves quantitative analysis of oscillatory behaviors using computer vision, as well as segmentation and statistical processing of confocal microscopy images with SAM and Fiji. Additionally, I model protein circuits and diffusion processes based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to better understand the underlying mechanisms of artificial cell division.

This project focused on artificial cell division driven by oscillatory phenomena, utilizing de novo protein design. My work involved the quantitative analysis of oscillatory behaviors using computer vision, as well as the segmentation and statistical processing of confocal microscopy images with SAM and Fiji. Additionally, I modeled protein circuits and diffusion processes using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of artificial cell division.

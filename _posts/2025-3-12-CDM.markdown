<!--In this paper, a simplified neuralon, capturing the stochastic nature of interference spikes. Internal interference, attributed to relative refractoriness, which is a neural property reflecting the reduced probability of spike generation shortly after neuron activation, is modeled using a dynamic threshold.-->

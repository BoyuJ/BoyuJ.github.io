<!--In this paper, a simplified neural communication model with external and internal interference is proposed. In our model, external interference from neighboring neurons is characterized by a Poisson distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of interference spikes. Internal interference, attributed to relative refractoriness, which is a neural property reflecting the reduced probability of spike generation shortly after neuron activation, is modeled using a dynamic threshold.-->

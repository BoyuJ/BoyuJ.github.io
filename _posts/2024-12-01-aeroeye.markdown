We aimed to build a snake-like robot system for aircraft engine damage detection. I was responsible for robot configuration design and used YOLOv5 to detect cracks based on a small dataset of metal cracks. We have won several awards including the Grand Prize of 2023-2024 Huawei ICT(Information and Communication Technology) Competition Global Final.
